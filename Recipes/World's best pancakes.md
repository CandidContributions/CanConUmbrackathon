# World's best pancakes

![Pippi Longstockings making pancakes](https://www.idunn.no/file/ci/67095050/900x/blft-2011-2-24-g005.jpg)

## Ingredients

* 3 dl fine wheat flour
* 4 huge eggs
* 5 dl milk
* 1 ts vanilla sugar
* 1 ts cardamom

## Hard work

Mix and sift the dry stuff. Add half the milk while stirring like crazy. You should look at a homogenous goo with no lumps.  
Whip up the eggs so they turn into a homogenous yellow goo, then add them to the dry stuff and milk.  
Continue to add milk while stirring your arm stiff, until there's nothing left in your measuring device.

## Relax

Put a towel over the bowl (hopefully) you used to mix the stuffs.  
Watch netflix for 20-30 minutes.

## Boring work

Heat one, or preferably two, frying pans to *pretty hot*. Add butter if they're of the sticky kind.  
Use a scoop to add something like a scoopful of goo to each frying pan.  
Swirl the goo around to fill the pans.  
Wait a few minutes.  
Make a huge heaving motion with each pan to launch the half-baked pancakes into the air.  
Make sure to catch the pancakes with the pans on their way down. They will hopefully have the non-fried end facing the floor on their way down.  
Wait a few more minuts, then dismount the pancakes from the pans.  
Repeat until there is no more goo.

## Eat

Eat with strawberry jam, sour cream, sugar, cinnamon, bacon (!) or other things that strikes your fancy.
