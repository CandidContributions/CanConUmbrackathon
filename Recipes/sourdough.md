# Sourdough

![Finished](https://github.com/CandidContributions/CanConUmbrackathon/blob/main/Recipes/img/sourdough/finished.jpg)

This consists of making a starter over the course of about a week (depending on how warm your kitchen is) and from the starter, making the bread itself.


This is based off this [Youtube Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg5nLQVg4VY)

On day 3, 5 and 7 - a lot of recipes ask you to throw away some of the starter. Rather than that, make a sour pancake out of the starter that you are discarding.

## Starter : 
* Day 1: 2 spoons flour + similar amount of warm water
* Day 2: 2 spoons flour + similar amount of warm water
* Day 3: Make a pancake with 1/2 of the starter. 2 spoons flour + warm water.
* Day 4: 2 spoons flour + warm water
* Day 5: Make a pancake with 1/2 of the starter. 2 spoons flour + warm water.
* Day 6: 2 spoons flour + warm water
* Day 7: Make sourdough with 1/2 of the starter. 2 spoons flour + warm water

Each day you keep adding to the starter, keep it somewhere warm. Cover it but NOT with a tight lid. If the lid is airtight it will probably either get stuck and in extreme cases explode (Literally!)

Put a bit of warm water in a bowl abd add a drop of starter. If it floats, it's ready to use.

In a mixing bowl, add 2/3 white flour, 1/3 wholemeal or any other flour. (500g white, 150g wholemeal). Sift the flour into a bowl, save the wholemeal bits to top the loaf with afterwards

The flour is mixed to a wettish mix. Like a really really thick porridge. Not liquid, but still very loose.

Then let it rest for 30 mins.

After resting, add salt and the starter. 

Then you knead - not normal knead process. Slap + fold for 10 mins. (Slap it onto surface,then fold over)

Then rest for 10 mins. 

Then Stretch and fold x 4. Stretch it out, and fold it over itself. 

Then rest for 10 mins. 

Then Stretch and fold x 4

Then rest for 10 mins. 

Then Stretch and fold x 4

Then rest for 10 mins. 

Then form it into a loaf - make the main surface nice and tight. Roll it horizontally until there's no seam.

Then proof it. Cloth into the basket, then flour, then dough in, cover with a teacloth and fridge overnight

Test : When you press on it, it should spring back.

To cook - in a dutch over (cast iron skillet with a lid in the oven, make it hot. 

Line the base with baking paper to help extract it. Lightly Oil the sides too.

When it's hot, score the top of the loaf to help it rise. 

Bake hot for 20 mins (240). 

Take the lid off the pan

Bake on 180 for 20 mins

Then let it cool for an hour before eating. REALLY IMPORTANT to let it cool or the dough will turn to a horrific mush
