From Wales, whilst it translates to "mottled bread" in English, it's a lovely cake to have with a cup of tea.  We also spread it with marge.  

We use this recipe from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/bara_brith_33441)

Ingredients
* 450g/1lb dried mixed fruit
* 250g/9oz brown sugar
* 300ml/½ pint warm black tea
* 2 tsp mixed spice
* 450g/1lb self-raising flour
* 1 free-range egg, beaten

Method
**In a large bowl soak the fruit and sugar in strained tea and leave overnight.** If you forget to do this the bara brith will be too dry.

Next day preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3. Line a 900g/2lb loaf tin with baking parchment.

Mix the remaining ingredients into the fruit mixture and beat well.

Pour the mixture into the loaf tin and bake the oven and bake for 1½ hours or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
