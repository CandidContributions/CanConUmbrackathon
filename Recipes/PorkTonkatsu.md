## Ingredients
- Jasmine Rice

    - I use this one : [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Goldfish-Japanese-Style-Curry-Concentrate/dp/B077P7F5YF/](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Goldfish-Japanese-Style-Curry-Concentrate/dp/B077P7F5YF/)
    - Or you can make your own from scratch : [https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/you-it-katsu-curry](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/you-it-katsu-curry)
- Boneless Pork Chops, or sliced pork loin
- Couple of eggs
- Flour 
- Panko Breadcrumbs (If you don't have any of these, just get some white bread, cut off the crusts and crumble the rest in a blender but not for too long)
- Pickled ginger for garnish
- Cabbage + a tiny bit of vinegar


## Prepare the cabage, rice and the sauce

First wash the rice (it'll be worth it - trust me) and boil it

Super finely shread cabbage, and soak for 15 mins in water + a dash of rice vinegar. Once soaked, dry it well and serve as a bed of cabbage under the katsu.

In a separate saucepan prepare the katsu sauce following instructions on the tin/recipe. 


## The Pork

For the pork - you want thin ish slices of chops without bones. About a centimetre thick.
Cut slices into the fat every few inches so the katsu doesn't buckle
Salt the meat, and stab it a few times. Just for fun, but also to tenderise the meat. Let it rest for 30 mins for the salt to do it's thing

Prepare the coating - you want 3 trays next to each other
Flour in a tray
Beaten eggs in a tray
Panko breadcrumbs in a tray

You dip the pork into each tray in turn, making sure you coat it all completely. 

Dip the meat in Flour, then egg, then flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs at the end.

Immediately fry the pork. Once it's gone a nice golden brown, let it drain. Remove any breadcrumbs from the oil between frying each one.

To serve : 
Rice, cabbage, pork, cut into slices and covered in sauce.
